# Data Processing
This phase involves several key activities aimed at transforming raw data into valuable information. Firstly, we begin by organizing and cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. This involves checking for missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any data anomalies or inconsistencies that may impact the quality of our analysis. Next, we apply various data manipulation techniques such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating to extract relevant subsets of data that align with our research questions and objectives. By focusing on specific variables or time periods, we can uncover patterns and trends that are essential for our analysis.
Once the data is prepared, we proceed to conduct exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. Through visualization techniques, statistical summaries, and data profiling, we explore the characteristics and relationships within the data, identifying potential insights and hypotheses to be further investigated. Throughout the process, we document our methodologies, decisions, and any assumptions made, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, we continuously evaluate and refine our analysis techniques, adapting as necessary to address emerging insights and refine our research questions.
